# SwiftUIWebViewDemoApp
SwiftUI-WebView Demo â€“ A lightweight sample app that wraps WKWebView in a pure-SwiftUI layer. It loads any URL (default: meliopayments.com), shows live navigation status, and adds reload/stop controls via the bottom toolbar. Perfect as a first reference for integrating WebKit with SwiftUI using an observable WebPage model.
